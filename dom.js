//DOM (Document Object Model)
//Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. 
// It represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects, allowing programming languages to manipulate the content, structure, and style of web pages dynamically.
//  The DOM provides a way to access and modify the elements of a web page, such as HTML tags, attributes, and text content.
